# C++ Gilded Rose Refactor

This is my refactor of the [Gilded Rose Refactoring Kata](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata) exercise.

## Building (Windows)

Install C++ development in the Visual Studio Installer.

With ```Developer Command Prompt for VS 2022```:
```
cmake --preset windows
```

Open the Visual Studio project file in the ```build``` folder.
